# a thing

## some plans

- obtain a gif (at random)
- obtain a text
- "rebuild" the gif (a-la-imagetexter) with the text, frame by frame
- Doesn't have to be saveable - just displayable

- instead of a gif, could just use any image, and do a drunkard's walk through it
- display a blown-up section, then move one of 8 directions and re-do
- it "animates" the colors  

## quick plan
1. stub out text-gen (single-char, whatever)
2. stub out color getter - alternate or something
3. build the darn squares
4. put some text in 'em
